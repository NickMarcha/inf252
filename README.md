Welcome to INF252 Visualization!

Visualization is the use of interactive graphical representations to support insights and shape conversations around data, which often are large and complex. The course covers the central aspects of the field of visualization, including visual perception, information visualization, volume and flow visualization, visual analytics/visual data science, and visual communication.

The application domains of visualization are numerous and multi-faceted, including medical diagnosis and treatment planning, the analysis of biological data, the oil and gas sector, digital humanities, finance, or even the exploration of social networks.

This course aims at teaching a basic understanding of visualization, both in theory and practice. In a combination of lectures, discussions, exercises, and the implementation of a visualization project, students of this course learn what visualization is, what visualization can support, and how a visualization may be considered successful.

For additional information and course learning objectives, please refer to the [UiB INF252 course page](https://www.uib.no/en/course/INF252).
